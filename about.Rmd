I have been teaching **R** and data analysis for several years now, but haven't been very good at staying organized and keeping all of my helpful materials (and fun things) I have found in one place. I hope that this website will be a living, evolving repository of fascinating and useful information for my students, and for any one else who might get some benefit from it.
