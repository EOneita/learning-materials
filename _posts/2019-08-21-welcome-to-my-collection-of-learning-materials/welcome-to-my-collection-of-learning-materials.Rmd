## Who am I?

I'm **Elizabeth Oneita Davis**, a postdoctoral associate in [Community Engagement](https://institute.sandiegozoo.org/community-engagement) at the [San Diego Zoo Institute for Conservation Research](https://institute.sandiegozoo.org/). I work on illegal wildlife trade in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. In the course of my role, I also teach statistics and data analysis, using **R**. My intention is for this website to serve as a repository of information for any past, present, or future students I may have.

I also hope to eventually translate these materials into Vietnamese, so if you are a Vietnamese #rstats user who wants to collaborate in creating Vietnamese-language materials, please get in touch!
